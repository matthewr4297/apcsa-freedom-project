# Entry 1
##### 10/18/19

Today, after three weeks in researching, I am beginning the blog entry for my APCSA freedom project. Not only that,
but I have also decited on what tool I would like to use inorder to create said project.

That being said, for a project
that you can make literally anything as long if it would work, it was hard chosing an idea that would be benifical to
work on.

I can say forsure that I want to create an Android app using Kotlin, a much improved version on Java and uses many of
the same features of Java such as its implimentation of the JVM and creating Android apps [More info on:https://kotlinlang.org ].
Additionally, leaflet.js caught my attention, since it allowed for 'mobile friendly interactive maps'. There are alot of
possibilities that could be used with this, and that follows up on what I am currently interested in creating.

I am invisioning an app that could allow users to find and share details on convienience stores using geographic locations
and user input on things such as what they bought, images of inside the store, customer satisfaction, and including API's
such as the Yelp API to get reviews on exsisting stores to gain an idea if someone should purchase from them or not.
I believe that this idea would go well with New Yorkers that are looking for a snack or drink fast, and also weither or not
the reputation of the store for confidence.

That is the main idea that I had that I came up with, but ofcorse, that is subject to change if something even better comes up.
