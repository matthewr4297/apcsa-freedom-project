# Entry 2
##### 11/17/2019

In the previous blog entry, I only just begun researching for something that I could create as my freedom project. For the time being, I was not 100 percent sure weather or not my idea would be able to stick or not, but that was 
almost a month ago from this current blog entry. Here is just some of the things that I have been doing within that timeframe
## What are you making?
Well... the idea from the previous entry had stuck.  
  
Which is creating an app which allows local New Yorkers (Or person in a metro area with small corner stores) to browse and discover 
local convinience stores, deli's, pizza parlor's, anything that is convinent that is not a well known franchise such as McDonald's.  
  
My goal is to give local's or tourists a tool to rate, discover, and advertise places that are lesser known to others outside of it's community, and also bring recognition and buisness to local favorites and reccomended places.    
## The Language

Since I am developing for Android, normal Java would work just fine, although there are some things that make Kotlin a much better option _in my 
opinion_. 
#### 1. Less code to write, gives the same effect  
    -One thing that I found out was how much more code you need to get a basic program running with Java compared to Kotlin.     
    *(While I do not feel detered by writing alot, writing less code makes it much easier to occur and manage problems.)*  
#### 2. Null point exceptions 
    -Null point exceptions are the most common way that an android app crashes. Kotlin includes a null type embedded in its type system. Meaning, developers do not have
    to worry about app crashes by a null value.  
#### 3. Kotlin and Java are entirely intercompiable  
    -Kotlin uses the Java Virtual Machine, and can be easily translated back to plain Java code as well. This adds alot of virsatility to the language, and also means that it wont be as hard to fully learn seeing Kotlin is a dirivative of Java. 
Although I am most likely going to be program using kotlin, it is good to know that I can use what I learned about in the APCSA course to help create the android app.
## What have I learned so far?!

Admittedly, not as much as you might have expected. Mainly because of both, working on Java homeworks that I have missed and also college decisions played a large factor to limiting my time I had to work on learning my freedom project topic...  
***that isnt to say that I have not learned anything at all***  
  
  
**Some things that I have learned in Kotlin are:**   


1. Kotlin uses two different keywords for to declare variables: val and var  
  
_val_'s are values that cannot be changed once they are assigned.  
_var_'s are values that are able to be changed after they have been assigned.  
  
The declaration statement for var's and val's is slightly different from Java: "var count: Int = 10"  
  
And that is pretty much it for what I learned for Kotlin.
## Sources I have used:
https://kotlinlang.org/ Used to get a basic understanding on Kotlin, as well as tinker with some example problems  
https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/building-ui The main tutorial I will be using to begin making an app with Android Studio. Will allow me to get a firm understanding on what I should and should not do when creating my project.  
https://www.androidauthority.com/develop-android-apps-languages-learn-391008/ Helped me gather some evidence on which language I should ultimately chose, but also gave me some interesting choices that I could have made in terms of language.
