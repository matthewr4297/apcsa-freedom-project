# Entry 5: Blog entrys are a pain
##### 3/19/20

I will do my best to explain what I have learned since entry 2, since I forgot to do entry's 3 and 4, and there is simply no point in completing those since I wont even get a point of credit for those submissions.
This so called 'Mega' entry will go over
* Where and how I learned,
* progress done with the main project
* Small apps that helped me learn
* Next steps from here

The time frame between from the last part to now, I have been learning about Android Studio through a udemy course titled "The Complete Android Oreo Developer Course"
There, it lead me to build very basic yet fundamentally important apps to get started

### !Note!
*When I figure out how to impliment images that will work inside of github, there will be images showing these specific aspects about the app*
* #### Android Studio 'tutorial'
    * The first app that I have developed from scratch.
    * Made to help with basic syntax when I was starting out, such as Text [known as textViews], Buttons, and images [imageViews].
    * Finished abruptly due to not initally knowing how to switch between sections, such as a section about Text and one about Images.
* #### Currency Converter
    * Helped improve my understanding of the layout of android apps
    * First app to incorperate a background which surrounds the entire app.
    * The first app which I was able to change the icon from the default green android icon to a custom icon that I had quickly created. Point being- it worked.
    * Takes a value, which is the amount of British Pounds to be converted into US Dollars [BP multiplied by 1.3].
    * A short message called a toast comes up and displays the amount converted.
* #### Higher or Lower game
    * Simple app that has you guessing what the generated number is
    * Use of ImageViews that originally were supposed to increase or decrease the guessed number by one.
    * Interactive logo, which displays toast text when clicked on.

However, while developing the higher or lower game, there came a great realization that occured to me while using Java to program.
### The syntax is simply way too long!
For example, take a look at one strand of code that I used for the higher or lower game:

` EditText numinput= (EditText) findViewById(R.id.numinput); `
This piece of code is just to convert the entered value the user entered and convert it to to a string.
` val numinput = findViewById<View>(R.id.numinput) as EditText `
In my opinion, I just think that if I am going to finish this project, writing the code in Java will remain repetitive and simply take too long.
