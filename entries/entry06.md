Final Entry

This entry serves to the the final one for the officaial SEP freedom project, which may or may not be the final for the current project as a whole.
So with that out of the way, lets get straight into buisness.

Sources:
I have been using youtube to work on the freedom project, as well as trying to get more information I desperately needed from my udemy course. The main issue that I had comming out of this
was the issue of language, as the youtube videos use kotlin while my udemy course uses java. While these two languages were very similar, there are many differences that made it hard to chose
one. I know I chose java initially, but after working with its syntax, I had wanted to make the switch. As a result, the MVP is not yet completed.
